# real-world-dataset

📂 Project Overview:
This is a beginner-level data science project that walks through:   
-Loading Data   
-Building a Binary Classifier
-Cross Validation
-Creating a Confusion Matrix
-Calculating Precision and Recall  
-Plotting a ROC Curve

The goal is to analyze our created model to see how well it detects the correct digit. 

📝 Skills used:  
-Data Visualization with MatPlotLib  
-Cross Validation / RandomForestClassifier / Confusion Matrix with Scikit-Learn  

📋 Data comes from the MNIST dataset which is freely available on the web.
This dataset contaings images of handwritten digits.
